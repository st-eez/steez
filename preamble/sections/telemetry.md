## Telemetry (run last)

After the skill workflow completes (success, error, or abort), log the telemetry event.
Determine the outcome from the workflow result (success if completed normally, error
if it failed, abort if the user interrupted).

**PLAN MODE EXCEPTION — ALWAYS RUN:** This command writes telemetry to
`~/.steez/analytics/` (user config directory, not project files). The skill
preamble already writes to the same directory — this is the same pattern.
Skipping this command loses session duration and outcome data.

Run this bash:

```bash
_TEL_END=$(date +%s)
_TEL_DUR=$(( _TEL_END - _TEL_START ))
# Local analytics only (no remote telemetry)
echo '{"skill":"{{SKILL_NAME}}","duration_s":"'"$_TEL_DUR"'","outcome":"OUTCOME","browse":"USED_BROWSE","session":"'"$_SESSION_ID"'","ts":"'$(date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ)'"}' >> ~/.steez/analytics/skill-usage.jsonl 2>/dev/null || echo "[steez] WARNING: telemetry write failed" >&2
```

Replace `OUTCOME` with success/error/abort, and `USED_BROWSE` with true/false based
on whether `$B` was used. If you cannot determine the outcome, use "unknown".
